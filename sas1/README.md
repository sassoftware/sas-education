# Modern Data Science with SAS Viya Workbench and Python

## Getting Started

Welcome to your first day at Styled and Sophisticated Enterprises (SASe), the premier online personal styling service in the World!  We connect clients across the globe to a personal stylist and offer a premium clothing subscription box.  No longer will busy professions need to search for clothing online.  We’ll give you a modern look, that will fit your style in both the boardroom and out on the town.​

​As a data scientist in our Customer Retention Department at SASe, you’ll help us use machine learning models to help us analyze customer churn. Customer “churn” simply means that our client has canceled their premium clothing subscription.  And since it often is more difficult to find a new customer than keep an existing one, you will help us identify which clients are likely on the cusp of churning, so that we can find ways to retain them.​

Your onboarding will take several weeks, but we’ll get you started today by examining the work of your predecessor.  This work will expose you to the typical activities and challenges you'll face in your daily job.​

For our lessons today, I will walk you through our customer retention project, which follows the classic analytics lifecycle.  And my goal here isn’t to have you understand everything happening within the data preparation and modeling phases, Instead, I seek to expose you to the wide data engineering + data science universe – so that you can follow-up with more detailed analysis later. ​

Additionally, we’ll show you your new coding environment, SAS Viya Workbench. SAS Viya Workbench is a lightweight, standalone development, modeling and coding environment for data scientists like you and me.​

I hope that you’re as excited as I am… so let’s get started! ​

## Course

The materials provided in this project are in support of the **Modern Data Science with SAS Viya Workbench and Python** course available on https://learn.sas.com/.

## View the Materials

We highly recommend to view these materials in **Visual Studio Code** with the **SAS Extension for Visual Studio Code** (https://github.com/sassoftware/vscode-sas-extension) installed.

Indeed, SAS notebooks (https://sassoftware.github.io/vscode-sas-extension/Features/sasNotebook) do not render properly in many Git web applications such as GitHub or GitLab.

## Installation

You can clone the ```sas-education``` repository using the command-line:

```
git clone https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-education.git
```

Then, you can access the available notebooks from this course in the ```sas1``` sub-folder and run them in your environment.
