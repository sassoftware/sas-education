# Accessing and Exploring Data

In this folder, youâ€™ll find SAS notebooks that demonstrate how to access different types of data.

Notebooks prefixed with "zDEMO" are included solely to show how data access is performed for specific sources, such as Google Cloud Storage or Snowflake, which we cannot easily provide as examples for hands-on.

However, you can use the non-prefixed versions to run the project with the equivalent provided datasets.

## Agenda

### Accessing and reading local files (CSV/JSON/SAS data set examples)

### Accessing and reading data lake files (Parquet on GCS example)

### Accessing and reading database/data lakehouse data (Snowflake example)
